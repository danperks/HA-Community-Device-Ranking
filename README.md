## Adding Devices

- Suggestions are all added by the commuinity and are in now way official recommendations from the HA team
- To add a new suggestion, make an Issue or Pull Request detailing why you think it should be added to the list. After any disccusions from other users have taken place, it will either be added or closed, based on the general concensus of the community
- The same process applys for removing suggestions, although the barrier to do so is higher than adding one
